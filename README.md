## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

- The challenge is pretty straightforward style-wise, but this time I tried using "utility" classes like .container, .card, .pill, and followed BEM naming throughout.
- Again, getting it to look "exactly" like in the design screenshots took me quite a while...
- Using vanilla js even for something as simple as this is _not_ easy!
